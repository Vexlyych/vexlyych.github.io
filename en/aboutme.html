  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <div class="p">
    <p>Hello! I'm Dan Mulkey. Born in Fairbanks, Alaska, currently living in Nichinan, Miyazaki. I'm passionate about
      health, technology, and their intersection, focusing on increasing human ability and wellbeing.</p>

    <p>With doctors on both sides of the family, I've been influenced by magnanimous character from a young age. I've
      also watched as loved ones struggle with failing health, and perfectly healthy minds are denied freedom of
      movement by neglect and chronic illness. I champion a preventative, multifactorial approach to health, promoting
      physical, mental, and spiritual actualization of the individual. As a healthcare professional, the primary
      affective dimension in patient care is, of course, the physical, through active conditioning, nutrition, and
      remediation of disease and mutagens. In treating a patient's physical needs, however, I believe it's important to
      support them in all three for a balanced and proactive recovery.</p>

  <div class="p">
    <p>Growing up during the turn of the millenium, I have fond memories of "Web 1.0". I'm a big fan of decentralized
      communities, open source, and modular software. Troubleshooting is incredibly fun, and helped me develop an
      approach to problem-solving that is lateral, analytical, and creative. Recently, I've been exploring 3D modelling
      and printing in an amateur capacity, and am excited to see printed prostheses, orthoses, and personal health
      monitors gain popularity and accreditation.</p>
